# 📩 Company Messaging Module

This module implements a **company-to-volunteer messaging system** using **Vue 3, Pinia, and Axios**.
It handles **conversations, recipients, sending and receiving messages**, and provides a **UI for browsing and chatting**.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Fetch and display valid message recipients.
* Fetch and display all conversations.
* Fetch and display messages for a given conversation.
* Send messages in real-time to other users.
* Sidebar for message previews with **search and filtering**.
* Chat interface with **message bubbles (sender/receiver styles)**.
* Profile image support for companies.
* Delete and mark conversations as unread.


## Store: `companyMessageStore.ts`

The **Pinia store** manages state and API calls.

### State

```ts
validRecipients: []   // list of people you can message
conversations: []     // list of conversations
messages: []          // messages inside conversations
error: ''             // API errors
```

### Actions

* `fetchValidRecipients()` → Get list of messageable users.
* `fetchConversations()` → Get all conversations for the logged-in user.
* `fetchMessages()` → Get all messages.
* `sendMessages(formData)` → Send a message to a user.

Each request attaches the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header from the `authStore`.

## Component: `CompanyMessages.vue`

The **sidebar + main chat container wrapper**.

* Fetches conversations, messages, recipients, and companies on **mount**.
* Implements **search** to filter recipients.

* Watches for route changes to reload messages when switching conversations.
* Handles **sending messages**:

  * Resolves the correct receiver ID.
  * Posts message via `sendMessages()`.
  * Refetches messages and scrolls to bottom.

Would you like me to make this README **more like production-level** (with installation, setup, dependencies, and usage instructions for developers), or just keep it **module-level** (focused only on messaging)?
